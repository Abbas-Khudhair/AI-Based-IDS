This project is a sophisticated AI-driven rule-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed to detect malicious behavior in network traffic. It consists of two main components:

The Steps:

1. Capture Network Data: Save a PCAP (Packet Capture) file from the network you wish to analyze. This file will serve as the input for further processing.


2. Convert PCAP to CSV: Utilize the provided Python script to convert the PCAP file into a CSV format. This step ensures the data is structured and readable for the next stages of analysis.


3. Run the Main Script: Execute the main script in the project to process the CSV file. The script analyzes the data to detect whether the network traffic is malicious or non-malicious.
